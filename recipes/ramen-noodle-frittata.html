    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Ramen noodles are baked into a frittata and topped with shredded cheese. My kids love this frittata for lunch! It's so easy to make!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 (3 ounce) packages chicken flavored ramen noodles</li>
        <li>6 eggs</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons butter</li>
        <li>Â½ cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place noodles in a saucepan filled with boiling water, reserving the seasoning packet. Cook until tender, and drain. In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs and seasoning packets from the noodles. Mix in noodles.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the noodle mixture, and cook over medium-low heat until firm, 5 to 7 minutes. Cut into fourths, and turn over to brown the other side for 1 to 2 minutes. Sprinkle cheese over the top, and serve.</li>
    </ol>
